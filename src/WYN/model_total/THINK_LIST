1. L1Loss or MSELoss? V
2. one-hot encodding network level? 
3. round makes result better V make sense if our model is accurate (round project the solution into the right space)
4. add/remove features won't change the result V change (65%->60%)


TODO(2019/09/26):
1. add testing and observe V
2. RNN
3. add Ping group prediction (chagne network maybe? something like 1 item is all 20-day data of commodity in the Ping group)

TODO(2019/9/27):
1. predict Ping group
